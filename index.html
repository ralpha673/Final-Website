            <p class="text_why">Mental Health Coin was founded due to the frugal funding in regard
                to the Mental Health service in the USA and UK. MHC is a way for us
                to use modern technology in hopes to support people who battle
                with mental illnesses, especially at a time when Mental Health is
                poorly funded. Additional to our wallet set aside for monthly
                donations we plan to host MHC events located around the
                world to bring more awareness to Mental Health as well as a
                parade of other utilities including free therapy.<br><br>Our vision at Mental Health Coin is to make Mental Health support available for everyone. We offer a way for users who buy $MHC to get access to free Mental Health utilities as well as indirectly contribute to the donations we make to various Mental Health charities. We believe that having access to Mental Health support should be available and affordable to anyone, but in a majority of the world this is not the case. 1 in 4 Adults suffer from at least one Mental Health issue in their life and 54% do not get access to any treatment due to lack of access. Limited options and long waits can contribute to the overall lack of access. MHC will not only donate to Mental Health oriented charities so these issues can be fixed, but we will establish free online treatment options. We want everyone that feels a need to seek help to be able to get the help they need with no issues, something that currently is a struggle for most. MHC believes that it will be able to make a significant impact within the Mental Health field worldwide alongside our community.
