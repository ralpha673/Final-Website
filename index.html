            </div>
            <p class="text_black">Mental Health Coin was founded due to the frugal funding in regard
                to the mental health service in the USA and UK. MHC is a way for us
                to use modern technology in hopes to support people who battle
                with mental illnesses, especially at a time when mental health is
                poorly funded. Additional to our wallet set aside for monthly
                donations we also hope to host MHC events located around the
                world to bring more awareness to Mental health as well as a
                parade of other utilities including free therapy.</p>

                We are giving 15% to the company. This is because funding free counseling for MHC holders is going to be costly and we would like our free counseling service to last forever. The MHC team are currently looking into ideas to make our free council service a stable program that can last for years. More on this topic will be spoken about in upcoming MHC podcasts.
